# IRIS Flower Classification

This project is about classifying the IRIS flowers into their respective species based on the given attributes.

## Project Description

The IRIS Flower Classification project aims to classify IRIS flowers into one of the three species (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the famous IRIS dataset, which is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals.

## Installation

The code is written in Python. To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
